# COP290: Software Engineering

## Course Overview

COP290 is a hands-on course designed to enhance your software engineering skills by focusing on various critical aspects of programming beyond mere functionality. The course aims to improve your ability to write production-quality software through better abstraction, efficient data structures, parallelization, effective debugging, and version control. 

## Key Learning Goals

1. **Abstraction and Organization**: Learn to organize code into classes and functions for better abstractions.
2. **Efficiency**: Implement data structures and parallelization techniques to enhance space-time efficiency.
3. **Compilation and Dependencies**: Use Makefiles to manage compilation and dependencies.
4. **Debugging**: Utilize gdb for debugging instead of relying on print statements.
5. **Version Control**: Employ git for version control to manage and collaborate on code effectively.
